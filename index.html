    <h1>Privacy Policy – PlankTon</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 22, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>PlankTon is a workout timer app (e.g., for planks). We <strong>do not collect any personal data</strong>. All settings are stored locally on your device and are optionally synchronized with your Apple Watch only.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>The app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Custom sounds uploaded by the user are stored locally only and are never sent to any server.</p>

    <h2>3. Apple Watch Synchronization</h2>
    <p>When using the companion Apple Watch app, settings (e.g., timer duration and selected sounds) are exchanged via Apple’s WatchConnectivity framework. This communication is end-to-end encrypted and takes place exclusively between your own devices. Apple acts as the data processor in this case (see Apple’s Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a>).</p>

    <h2>4. Analytics & Advertising</h2>
    <p>PlankTon contains no analytics tools, trackers, or advertisements.</p>

    <h2>5. Children</h2>
    <p>PlankTon does not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 (or the applicable age in your country).</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be published on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact us:<br>
