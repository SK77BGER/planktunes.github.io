<h1>Privacy Policy – PlankTon</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 22, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
<p>PlankTon is developed and published by:<br>
   Stefan Kärst<br>
   Gartenstr. 50, 13355 Berlin, Germany<br>
   Email: support@planktunes.com</p>

<h2>2. We Collect No Personal Data</h2>
<p>PlankTon does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All timer settings, custom sounds, and preferences are stored exclusively locally on your device.</p>

<h2>3. Apple Watch Synchronization</h2>
<p>When using the optional Apple Watch companion app, settings are transferred between your iPhone and Apple Watch using Apple’s WatchConnectivity framework. This transfer is end-to-end encrypted and occurs solely between devices owned by you. Apple acts as a data processor in this context. For details, see Apple’s Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a></p>

<h2>4. Legal Basis (GDPR – EU/EEA/UK)</h2>
<p>Since no personal data is processed by us, there is no legal basis under Art. 6 GDPR required. The synchronization via WatchConnectivity is based on your consent when pairing your Apple Watch with your iPhone (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) and Apple’s legitimate interest in providing device synchronization (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights (GDPR – EU/EEA/UK)</h2>
<p>As we do not process any personal data, the rights under Articles 15–22 GDPR (access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection) do not apply. For data processed by Apple, please contact Apple directly.</p>

<h2>6. Children</h2>
<p>PlankTon is not directed to children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy. Changes will be published on this page.</p>

<h2>8. Contact</h2>
<p>For any questions: <a href="mailto:support@planktunes.com">support@planktunes.com</a></p>
